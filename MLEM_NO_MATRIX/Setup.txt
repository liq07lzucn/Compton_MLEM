  File Naming
1)    Name of the input file              = 180315-run7-cs137_at_05_-05_11mm-2hrs-BigE-UnPhy-ComL_2x_d1
2)    Added Modifier to the output name   =
3)    Load previous iteration             =

  Defining the Source Space
-    X-limits = -50.0 , 50.0
-    Y-limits = -50.0 , 50.0
-    Z-limits = -50.0 , 50.0

-    The number of voxels per dimension x,y,z  = 100 , 100 , 100
-    The number of threads per iteration block = 250
-    The number of iteration blocks            = 4000
  THE NUMBER OF VOXELS MUST EQUAL THE NUMBER OF ITERATION THREADS

  Defining the Event Data
-    The total number of imported cones       = 20000
-    The number of threads per cone block     = 200
-    The number of cone blocks                = 100
  THE NUMBER OF CONES MUST EQUAL THE NUMBER OF CONE THREADS

  Run Length and Saves
-    The total number of iterations     = 150
-    The number of iterations per save  = 150

  Other Parameters
-    The Noise Reducing Cutoff as a fraction of the maximum value  = 0.001
-    The assumed uncertainty in the energy measurements in MeV     = 0.02

  Method of Saving Data (Can have more than one selected)
-    DAT files in the same format as those produced by CORE = 1
-    CSV files to be used in Matthew's plotting codes       = 1
